# Program Design: Introduction 110 - Assessments

Welcome to the **Program Design: Introduction 110 Assessments** repository! Here, you'll find my implementations of assessments and projects for the Program Design: Introduction module. This course focuses on object-oriented (OO) programming, covering concepts including inheritance, multiple inheritance, polymorphism, operator overloading, memory management (static and dynamic binding), interfaces, encapsulation, reuse, etc. The module teaches sound program design with an emphasis on modular code, leading to well-structured, robust, and documented programs. A modern OO programming language is used as the vehicle to develop these skills. The module will introduce the student to basic data structures, lists, stacks, and queues.

## Course Description

The **Program Design: Introduction 110** module provides a comprehensive introduction to object-oriented programming concepts. You will explore various aspects of OO programming, such as inheritance, polymorphism, memory management, interfaces, and encapsulation. The focus is on teaching you how to design modular and well-structured code that leads to robust and maintainable programs. We will use a modern OO programming language to develop and apply these skills. Furthermore, the module introduces basic data structures like lists, stacks, and queues.

## Assessments

In this repository, you'll find the assessments that I completed as part of the Program Design: Introduction 110 course. Each assessment is provided in separate folders and includes clear instructions, code templates, and any additional resources required to complete the tasks.
