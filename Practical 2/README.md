**Program Design Practical: Car Management System**

This practical assignment entails the implementation of a comprehensive program design involving dynamic memory allocation, copy constructors, assignment overloading, and destructors. The assignment revolves around the creation of a system to manage cars, engines, and accessories, guided by an outlined class structure, member variables, constructors, methods, and their relationships, as depicted in a provided UML diagram. Meticulous memory management and thorough testing are integral to this assignment. A detailed elucidation of the prerequisites and tasks is available in the furnished specification document.

**Usage:**

To compile and execute the program on a Linux environment, utilize the command `make run`. Cleaning the compilation artifacts can be achieved by entering `make clean`. If the necessary compilers are available, `make coverage` assesses the test coverage of the classes, while `make valgrind` identifies memory leaks. Windows users can replace 'rm' with 'del' in the commands, and note that 'valgrind' and 'coverage' might exhibit limitations in the Windows command prompt.
